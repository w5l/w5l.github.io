### Adjusting the chain tension

Loosen the nut on the axle of the rear wheel (left) and the fixing nut of guide sleeve (right); also
loosen the anchor bolt of the brake drum, then act on the appropriate adjusting screws of the chain 
adjuster forks, (in equal proportions to not decentralize the wheel). With the machine on the center 
stand the chain should not be too tight (check that it has a play of approximately 40 mm). This is 
necessary because otherwise there would be an excess tension when the swing arm is halfway. After 
having properly adjusted the chain, check the brake adjustment.
