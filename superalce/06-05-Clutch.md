### Clutch adjustment

In practise, three problems might occur:

1. The clutch snatches, engagement is abrupt and violent:
  - It can caused by on too tight springs: loosen the knurled disc (**Fig. 9**). The springs should 
    be compressed just enough to have a length of about 27.5 mm;
  - Worn or warped discs: replace;
  - Impurities between discs: wash with gasoline by pouring it from the top of the plug hole in 
    the middle left cover and draining it from the plug hole in the bottom, after turning the 
    engine at low speed and repeatedly pulling the clutch lever. Once washed, pour about 60 grams 
    of engine oil into the clutch.
     
2. The clutch slips, there is movement between the discs, even when the lever is completely released.
  - It can be caused by on too weak springs; tighten the knurled disc (**fig. 9**) or replace the 
    springs;
  - Lack of play between external control lever and internal control rod: set the free play play 
    (approx. 0.2mm) by adjusting the tensioner on the clutch control cable;
  - Excessive oil leaks in the clutch: perform the washing (see above). If the issue 
    persists, please check the condition of the stuffing box and clean the pipe placed in the 
    crankcase discharging oil on the chain.
    
3. The clutch will not disengage completely; dragging occurs between the fixed and the movable parts 
   of the clutch, even when the level is completely pulled. This causes difficult starts and noisy 
   gear changes. The problem may depend on:
  - Excessive play between lever and internal control rod: adjust the free play (see above).
  - Excessive wear of the control cable: replace;
  - Dirty discs: operate the washing (see above).
